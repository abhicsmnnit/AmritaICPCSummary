Lecture 1
Online judges can perform 10^8 operations per second.
So, if the input size is 20000, and you have O(n^2) algo, then it'll roughly take 20000^2 = 4X10^8 operations, i.e. 4 seconds.
If the allowed time limit is 1 or 2 seconds, then your algo will not work.

Heaps in C++ -> priority_queue

Lecture 13
. Binary Search: First 18 implementations of Binary Search in UNIX production code were buggy. (To be removed later on when I find a proper place to write this info).
. Top Coder Tutorial on Binary Search.
. Finding mid in Binary Search:
mid = (low + high) / 2 ==> BUGGY (If low and high are large enough to add up out of the Integer Range, we'll get an overflow).
mid = low + (high - low) / 2 ==> CORRECT
. When you implement a Binary Search Algo, always make sure it runs for {0, 1} (or ANY two consecutive elements in your search space)
This is the most probable case for ending in an infinite loop.
. Make sure in every iteration, the search space reduces by ATLEAST 1.
The main reason you go into infinite loop is that the search space does not decrease.
. **Whenever you face a problem of maximizing the minimum, or minimizing the maximum, its high chances that the problem will be solved using Binary Search**

Lecture 22
. a = b (mod n) [Read as a congruent b modulo n. The sign is actually a triple equal]
  => a % n = b % n
. (a + b) % c = (a % c + b % c) % c
. (a - b) % c = (a % c - b % c) % c
. (a * b) % c = (a % c * b % c) % c

Lecture 27
. Formula for finding power of p in n!:
  [n / p] + [n / p^2] + [n / p^3] + ...
  Here [] is the Greatest Integer Function.

Lecture 30
. To get a good feel of DP, solve TopCoder problems as they are more DP-oriented.
