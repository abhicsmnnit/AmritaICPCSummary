Lecture 15
?? Given an array of x coordinates, find x which minimizes
SUM(i=1 to n) |x[i] - x|
This can be formulated in the form of a word problem in the following way:
You have N offices of your company. You want to build the Headquarter (H) in such a way that the total distance of each office from the Headquarter is minimized.
                    ---1----2---3--4--------5----H---6------------------N--------
Total distance of each office from Headquarter = 1H + 2H + 3H + ... + NH
i.e. SUM(i=1 to N) |X[i] - X[H]|

!! The given function will be of the form y = |x - 1| + |x - 2| or y = |x - 1| + |x - 2| + |x - 3|
Try to make graphs for these and you will see that these are Unimodal, and therefore Ternary Search is Applicable.
The Perfect location of the Headquarter will be where the function is minimum, i.e. at the Minima of y (which can be found by using Ternary Search).

However, there is an easier solution for this problem.
For even number of points (i.e. when N is even), the function will be minimum over a RANGE.
For odd number of points, the function will have a minimum point.
The location of the Headquarter is actually the MEDIAN of the points given.
When you'll make the graphs of the above functions, you'll see this.
